    This is attendance monitoring sytem via facial recognition. We will be using OpenCV & Jupyter notebook for this application. OpenCV is an open-sourced image processing library that is very widely used not just in industry but also in the field of research and development.

    1) In command prompt write following command:</p>  
  pip install -r <mark>requirements.txt</mark>
  
 And press enter. All the necessary files will be installed.
      
      2) Now we need to add the users who need to be detected in the image_folder folder.
    In my case, I have added the images of 2 people, one is me and the other 1 is cricketer.
      
      3)Now we are good to go. Run the app & stand infront of the cam showing your face.
  
       The face has been detected and the attendance has been updated in the spreadsheet with respective time.
